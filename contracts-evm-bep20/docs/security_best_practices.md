# Security Best Practices & Audit Checklist

## Overview
USDExchangeToken is designed for military-grade security, auditability, and modular upgradability. This document summarizes all implemented security measures and provides a professional audit checklist.

## Security Principles
- **Centralized Role Management:** All permission checks are delegated to RoleManager; no direct admin logic in the main contract.
- **Multisig/Timelock Enforcement:** All admin-level actions require multisig or timelock approval, preventing single-point-of-failure.
- **Interface-Based Modularity:** All manager contracts interact via interfaces, minimizing cross-contract risk and upgrade complexity.
- **Event Logging:** All critical state changes and admin actions are logged with detailed events for full traceability.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each module is isolated and upgradable, reducing blast radius of potential bugs.
- **OpenZeppelin Standards:** ERC20 and AccessControl implementations are based on well-audited OpenZeppelin contracts.
- **Edge-Case & Fuzz Testing:** Comprehensive tests for permission, edge-case, and attack scenarios.

## Implemented Protections
- **Reentrancy:** No external calls in critical state-changing functions; manager contracts can be extended with reentrancy guards if needed.
- **Overflow/Underflow:** All arithmetic uses Solidity 0.8+ built-in checks.
- **Access Control:** All sensitive functions are protected by RoleManager and/or onlyMultisigOrTimelock.
- **Timelock (Optional):** Delays for admin actions can be enforced for extra safety.
- **Blacklist/Anti-Bot:** SecurityManager enforces blacklist, anti-bot, and transfer limits.
- **Vesting/Lock:** VestingManager and SecurityManager enforce token locks and vesting schedules.
- **Fee Exemption:** FeeManager allows for granular fee exemption and recipient control.
- **Emergency Pause:** Pauser and Emergency roles can halt transfers in case of attack.

## Audit Checklist
- [x] All admin-level functions restricted to multisig/timelock
- [x] All role checks delegated to RoleManager
- [x] No direct AccessControl in main contract
- [x] All manager contracts use interface-based access
- [x] All critical state changes emit events
- [x] Blacklist, anti-bot, and transfer limits enforced
- [x] Vesting and lock logic tested for edge-cases
- [x] Fee logic and exemptions tested
- [x] Governance and proposal logic tested
- [x] Comprehensive edge-case and fuzz tests
- [x] No reentrancy in critical functions
- [x] All arithmetic uses Solidity 0.8+ checks
- [x] All contracts reviewed for upgradability and separation of concerns

## Recommendations for Auditors
- Review all event logs for traceability
- Test all admin-level actions via multisig/timelock
- Attempt privilege escalation via manager contract upgrades
- Fuzz test all permission and transfer logic
- Review all fallback and receive functions (if any)
- Simulate emergency scenarios (pause, blacklist, lock)
